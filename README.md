# TIL - Today I Learned

Every day we learn something new. If we find something useful, why not share with the rest of the team? This is why we have this repo - to share and learn new ideas.


## How to add new things?

Just create a new file named after the "til" you want to share. Create a new file in a directory related to your "til" - feel free to add a new directory if necessary.
